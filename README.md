# Object Detection using TensorFlow Hub

This repository contains code for performing object detection using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. The code utilizes a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub to detect objects in images.

## Setup

1. Install the required libraries:
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub matplotlib pillow


2. Run the code in a Python environment that supports TensorFlow.

## Usage

1. Run the code in a Python environment to perform object detection on images.
2. The code downloads images from specified URLs, resizes them, and runs object detection using the pre-trained model.
3. Detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes and labels on the images.

## Code Structure

- `object_detection.py`: Contains the main code for object detection.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `object_detection.py` script.
3. Specify the image URLs for object detection.
